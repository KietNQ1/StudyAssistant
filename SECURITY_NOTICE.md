# üîí Security Notice

## Development JWT Key

The JWT key documented in this repository's setup guides:
```
StudyAssistantDevKey2024SecretAtLeast32Chars!@#
```

**Is intentionally shared and documented because:**

1. ‚úÖ **Development ONLY** - Used exclusively for local development environments
2. ‚úÖ **Team Collaboration** - Allows team members to test with tokens generated by others
3. ‚úÖ **NOT Production** - Production uses different, secret keys via secure configuration
4. ‚úÖ **No Security Risk** - Local development tokens have no access to production data or systems

## Production Security

**Production environment uses:**
- ‚ùå NOT the documented development key
- ‚úÖ Secure secrets management (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Environment-specific JWT keys with proper rotation
- ‚úÖ Proper authentication and authorization checks

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Safe to Document (Development)
- Shared development JWT key for team sync
- Local database connection strings (SQLite)
- Development API endpoints
- Test account credentials (if any)

### ‚ùå NEVER Document (Production)
- Production JWT signing keys
- Production database credentials
- Service account private keys
- API keys with billing/access to real data
- User passwords or personal information
